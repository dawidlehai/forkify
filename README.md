This project was created as a part of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ 'Udemy') course _The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!_ by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman 'Jonas Schmedtmann on Twitter').

In the project I used:

- Object-oriented programming as well as functional programming paradigms
- Publisher-subscriber design pattern to solve event handling problem
- AJAX calls with [Forkify API v2](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2 'Forkify API v2')
